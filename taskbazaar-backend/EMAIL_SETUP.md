# Email Notification Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Gmail account (or other email service)
2. App password for your email account

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create .env file
Create a `.env` file in the `taskbazaar-backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-factor authentication if not already enabled
3. Go to Security â†’ App passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Use this password as your `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

### 3. Alternative Email Services
If you want to use a different email service, modify the transporter in `services/emailService.js`:

```javascript
// For Outlook/Hotmail
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'outlook',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD
  }
});

// For custom SMTP
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: 'smtp.your-provider.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD
  }
});
```

## Testing Email Setup
1. Start your backend server
2. Accept a task as a provider
3. Check if the task poster receives an email notification

## Email Templates
The system includes three email templates:
- **Task Assigned**: Sent when a provider accepts a task
- **Task Completed**: Sent when a task is marked as completed
- **Task Cancelled**: Sent when a task is cancelled

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure your email and app password are correct
- Check that 2-factor authentication is enabled for Gmail
- Verify your firewall isn't blocking SMTP connections
- Check server logs for email sending errors
